# asiaam-191a-la-heat-disparities

## What social problem is being addressed?
At a macro level, the urban heat island effect in Los Angeles. At a micro level, this project attempts to understand how residents in Little Tokyo deal with heat in their neighborhood. 

## Who is being empowered by your mapplication?
Communities who are disproportionately impacted by the urban heat island effect, namely low-income and communities of color.

## What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?
- Technical
    - How to elicit heat stories from Little Tokyo residents. It might be difficult to recollect a story or a memory of dealing with heat through just the survey
    - Collecting stories from a diverse group of Little Tokyo residents. We want to cast a wide net and gather stories form all demographics living in Little Tokyo and not exclude any particular group from participation. 

- Ethical 
    - Privacy: Our study could potentially involve personally identifying information like income, address, and ethnicity
    - Must not minimize people's concerns. There will be some qualitative/subjective input from users regarding their personal situations. We need to properly represent those perspectives 

## Technology used for this project
TBD

## How others could use this in the future
The user stories gathered from this mapplication can be a critical data point for several community-based projects, including decision-making made by politicians, urban planners, local business development, and so on.
